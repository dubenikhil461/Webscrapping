# 🕷️ Web Scraping Project

## 📄 Description

This project is dedicated to learning and mastering web scraping using modern tools in the Node.js ecosystem. The goal is to understand how data can be programmatically extracted from websites, even when they involve complex HTML structures, cookies, headers, CAPTCHAs, and dynamic content rendered with JavaScript.

This project will be structured in stages, from static scraping using Cheerio to dynamic page scraping using Puppeteer and Playwright.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Understand the fundamentals of HTTP requests, headers, status codes, and cookies.
- Learn how to fetch and parse HTML data using Cheerio.
- Scrape static websites (e.g., blogs, e-commerce product pages).
- Manage form submissions and session cookies.
- Handle pagination and filtering of data.
- Scrape dynamic content using headless browsers (Puppeteer/Playwright).
- Solve CAPTCHA using OCR tools like `tesseract.js`.
- Store scraped data to files or databases (MongoDB or JSON).
- Respect `robots.txt` and ethical scraping guidelines.
